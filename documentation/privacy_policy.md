Data Categories:
Personal Information: User names, email addresses, payment details (for subscription or in-app purchases).
Platform Interaction Data: Player preferences, usage patterns, and feature interactions.
Fantasy Game Data: Player stats, team rankings, league preferences, and historical game data.
Documentation: Maintain a clear and accessible record of each data type, its collection purpose, and its necessity for platform operations.
Data Minimization

Key Data:
Essentials Only: User emails for notifications, account management, and transaction history for billing or league administration purposes.
Review and Reduce: Regularly review data collection practices to ensure no unnecessary data is collected or stored.
Outcome: Minimizing data collection reduces compliance risk and enhances user confidence in the platform’s data-handling practices.
Data Retention Policy

Retention Guidelines:
Account Information: Retain PII for active users and automatically delete or anonymize inactive accounts after a specific period (e.g., 1 year of inactivity).
Transaction and Financial Records: Retain per financial regulations for auditing purposes.
Usage Data: Shorter retention period (e.g., 6 months) for interaction data, balancing insight generation with privacy.
Documentation: Clearly communicate the retention policy in the privacy policy and maintain an internal record of data deletion schedules.

Right to Access: Allow users to request a copy of their stored data through account settings, with a downloadable file provided upon request.
Right to Rectify: Enable users to update or correct personal information through an “Edit Profile” feature.
Right to Delete: Provide a straightforward “Delete Account” option that informs users about the data loss implications and confirms account deletion.
Right to Portability: Ensure users can download their data in a machine-readable format (e.g., CSV) if they choose to leave the platform.
Cookie Consent Management

Action: Implement a tool for obtaining user consent for cookies and tracking.
Options:
Tools: Use Google Tag Manager or Cookiebot for tracking consent, managing cookies, and allowing users to modify cookie preferences or withdraw consent.
