{
  "league_name": "Elite Fantasy League",
  "league_logo_url": "https://example.com/logos/league-logo.png",
  "league_primary_color": "#ff5733",
  "league_secondary_color": "#33c1ff",

  "team_logo_url": "https://example.com/logos/team-wolves.png",
  "team_primary_color": "#1e90ff",
  "team_secondary_color": "#32cd32",

  "team_uniform_design": {
    "home": "blue jersey with green stripes",
    "away": "white jersey with blue stripes"
  },
  "team_facilities": "Wolf Den Stadium"
}

Scoring Modifiers

Apex Fantasy Football allows commissioners to implement additional scoring modifiers to add more depth to the league strategy:

Scoring Modifier Options:

	•	Head Coach Impact: Adjust team performance based on the head coach’s real-world game management.
	•	Team Captains: Provide scoring boosts or bonuses based on the performance of designated team captains.
	•	Home Field Advantage: Give advantages to teams playing at their home stadium to reflect real-world dynamics.
	•	Best Bench: Reward teams with the best-performing bench players, encouraging deeper roster management.
	•	Custom Scoring Bonuses: Add additional scoring categories or bonuses, such as longest touchdown, clutch performances, or high-yardage games.
	•	Weather Conditions: Option to factor in real-time weather conditions for home games that affect player performance.

Example Configuration for Scoring Modifiers:

Modify the scoring rules in your league setup to apply specific scoring modifiers:

{
  "scoring_modifiers": {
    "head_coach_impact": {
      "bonus_points_per_win": 2,
      "penalty_points_per_loss": -1
    },
    "team_captains": {
      "captain_bonus": 1.5
    },
    "home_field_advantage": {
      "bonus_points": 3
    },
    "best_bench": {
      "bonus_for_best_bench": 2
    },
    "custom_bonuses": {
      "longest_td": 5,
      "clutch_performance": 4,
      "weather_adjustment": {
        "rain_penalty": -2,
        "snow_bonus": 1
      }
    }
  }
}

In the backend, you can implement these scoring modifiers by adjusting the scoring logic. For example:

# backend/scoring.py

def apply_scoring_modifiers(team_stats, modifiers):
    score = team_stats['base_score']
    
    # Apply head coach impact
    if team_stats['coach_won']:
        score += modifiers['head_coach_impact']['bonus_points_per_win']
    else:
        score += modifiers['head_coach_impact']['penalty_points_per_loss']
    
    # Apply captain bonus
    score += team_stats['captain_score'] * modifiers['team_captains']['captain_bonus']
    
    # Home field advantage
    if team_stats['is_home_game']:
        score += modifiers['home_field_advantage']['bonus_points']
    
    # Custom scoring rules
    if team_stats['longest_td'] >= 50:
        score += modifiers['custom_bonuses']['longest_td']
    
    # Weather adjustments
    if team_stats['weather'] == 'rain':
        score += modifiers['custom_bonuses']['weather_adjustment']['rain_penalty']
    elif team_stats['weather'] == 'snow':
        score += modifiers['custom_bonuses']['weather_adjustment']['snow_bonus']
    
    return score
